# Store

<PackageInfo name="@jlnstack/store" />

Type-safe store built on top of [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).

Inspired by [TkDodo's Zustand best practices](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/working-with-zustand).

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { createReactStore } from "@jlnstack/store/react"

const BearStore = createReactStore({
  name: "BearStore",
  state: (initialBears: number) => ({
    bears: initialBears,
    fish: 10,
  }),
  actions: (set) => ({
    increasePopulation: (by: number) =>
      set((state) => ({ ...state, bears: state.bears + by })),
    eatFish: () =>
      set((state) => ({ ...state, fish: state.fish - 1 })),
  }),
})

export const { Provider, useStore, useActions } = BearStore
```
