# Routes

<PackageInfo name="@jlnstack/routes" />

Routes is a framework-agnostic, type-safe path builder optimized for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) file-based routing. Define your routes once and get full type inference when building path strings.

## Why Routes?

- **Type-safe paths** — Autocomplete route segments and params with full TypeScript inference.
- **Framework agnostic** — Outputs plain strings. Use with any router, `fetch`, or `redirect`.
- **Next.js optimized** — First-class support for [typed routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/typedRoutes) and dynamic segment conventions.
