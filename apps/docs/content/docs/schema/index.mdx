# Schema

<PackageInfo name="@jlnstack/schema" />

A utility library for [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) compatible libraries like Zod, Valibot, and ArkType.

This is **not** a schema validation library. Use your preferred schema library for that.

## Versioned Schema

Handle schema evolution with explicit versioning and migration chains.
